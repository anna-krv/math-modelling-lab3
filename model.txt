comments for info_format: 
a,b,c,d - system is observed in [a,b]x[c,d]
T - [0,T] - is time interval
y(x1, x2, t) - is actual solution
[(x1_i, x2_i)] - points for initial conditions at time t=0 for operator Lu(.,.,.)=u(.,.,0)
[(x1_i, x2_i, t_i)] - points for boundary conditions for operator Lu(x1, x2, t) = du/dx1
